# Group 30 Project
Job Platform for Blue-Collar and Informal Workers

Project Overview

Blue-collar and informal workers such as farmers, drivers, and masons often struggle to find work because of the lack of an online presence and limited digital tools. This platform connects such workers with employers who are looking for competent workers to assist them with tasks and solves a vital problem in the provision of work and employment opportunities.

Problem Statement

Workers in the informal sector often donâ€™t have a digital footprint, which makes it hard for them to find work.

Employers face challenges in finding and accessing reliable skilled labor for immediate and local needs.

There is no clear, simple, and appropriate solution using minimal technology designed for this segment of the labor market.

Why This Project Works

Provides and optimizes access for both employers and workers, creating a two-sided market with minimal friction.

Allows seamless expansion geographically and across sectors such as construction, domestic work, agriculture, and others.

Enables the empowerment of marginalized workers and strengthens local employment systems, resulting in positive and significant social and economic effects.
